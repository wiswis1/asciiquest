# Coding-Kickoff-2025

Welcome to Coding Kickoff 2025! I hope you learn a lot about git, github, and github desktop!

In this repository, you'll find a LONG folder path all the way to `asciiquest` (The actual path will be `src/com/coding_kickoff/asciiquest`).

## AsciiQuest - A Tiny Terminal Dungeon Game (Based on [this](https://www.dosgames.com/game/asciiquest/))

AsciiQuest is a turn-based dungeon crawler where a hero (The character `@`) moves in a small ASCII grid, collects treasure (The character `$`) WHILE avoiding monsters (The scary `M`)!

Running this application will lead you to a beautiful world of colorful text, adventures, and learning. I hope you come back in one piece, brave adventurer of git!

**Pssh: Run the files `run.bat` (Windows) or `run.sh` (Unix) to enter the treacherous dungeon. You have been warned!** - *A wizard who shalt not be named.*
